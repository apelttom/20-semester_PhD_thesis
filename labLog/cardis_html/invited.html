<p><b>White-Box Cryptography and Smart Cards: Friend or Foe?</b> by <a href="http://www.whiteboxcrypto.com/about.php">Brecht Wyseur</a>: Nagra</p>
<p>
When cryptographic algorithms are implemented in libraries that are executed on open devices, they are subject to so-called white-box attacks.
These are attacks where the adversary has full access to the implementation and the execution environment.
White-box cryptography (WBC) is the technology that aims to mitigate such attacks at the implementation-level.
This technology is increasingly used in industry and has recently gained additional attention with new analysis methodologies which have found their inspiration in Differential Power Analysis techniques.
In this talk, we introduce the current state of the art in WBC and highlight some interesting relations between research in WBC and research in the cryptographic hardware community.
While WBC seems to be on the other spectrum of cryptographic R&D - focusing on pure software implementations - we show that there are nevertheless interesting synergies.
We present several of these and conclude with a comparison between technologies.

Brecht Wyseur is a cryptography expert and security architect at Nagravision S.A., a Kudelski Group company based in Lausanne, Switzerland.
He has worked at NAGRA for the past 6 years in end-to-end key management systems for Digital TV.
Brecht completed his PhD in cryptography at COSIC, KU Leuven with Prof. Bart Preneel, with his dissertation on white-box cryptography.

<p><b>Leakage Resilient Masking Schemes</b> by <a href="http://www.foc.rub.de/people/faust.html">Sebastian Faust</a>: Ruhr-Universität Bochum</p>
<p>
Masking schemes are widely used in practice to defeat side-channel
attacks, which exploit the power consumption of devices. At the same
time a large body of recent theoretical works study feasibility of
computation in the presence of leakage and attempts to provide a
formal security analysis of the masking countermeasure. In this talk,
we will review some recent advances in the formal security analysis of
masking schemes and present efficient ways how to apply the masking
countermeasure at smart card level.

  <b>Bio:</b>
  Sebastian Faust is currently an assistant professor at the
  Ruhr-University of Bochum where he is working on topics related to
  both theoretical and applied cryptography, including leakage and
  tamper resilient cryptography and cryptographic protocol design. One
  of his main interests is to extend the proof-driven security analysis
  to the level where abstract cryptographic algorithms and protocols are
  implemented in the real-world.
  His research appears frequently at leading security and crypto
  conferences (CRYPTO, EUROCRYPT, ASIACRYPT, TCC, ICALP) and journals
  (SIAM Journal of Computing). He also has served as a PC member of
  several international conferences, including EUROCRYPT, Theory of
  Cryptography Conference (TCC), and Conference on Public Key Cryptography (PKC).
  He is a recipient of the Emmy Noether grant from the German Science
  Foundation, a Marie-Curie Intra-European Fellowship (2013-2014) and a
  Microsoft Research PhD scholarship (2007-2010). He is a co-author of
  the Best Paper Award of EUROCRYPT 2014.
