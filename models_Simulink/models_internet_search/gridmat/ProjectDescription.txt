Tool Overview

Modeling a complex, large-scale, heterogeneous, multi-physics, multi-domain, and distributed system like microgrid requires heterogeneous 
composition of physical, computational, and communication sub-systems including their causality, time semantics, and different physical domains.

State-of-the-art distribution grid and/or microgrid modeling & simulation tools are domain-specific and are mostly capable to capture only the physical 
components (power system and energy resources) of the model. However, common to most of the tools is that these tools do not provide a test bed 
to simulate an energy distribution model like residential microgrid where power system modeling at a very detailed level, 
e.g. at appliance level is required. To solve this problem of modeling detailed residential power systems of a residential microgrid, 
we have used GridLAB-D, an agent-based power system modeling and simulation tool.

Existing power system modeling tools including GridLAB-D lack the capability to capture the cyber-components 
(control, software, communication, and embedded hardware) during modeling and simulation. Therefore, new methodology 
and/or tool are required to integrate various domain-specific tools.

In this project, we are following model-based design approach. We have developed a Matlab/Simulink tool box for GridLAB-D that supports modeling, 
simulation, grid impact analysis, and validation of power & control systems of a residential microgrid. Details will come soon.
