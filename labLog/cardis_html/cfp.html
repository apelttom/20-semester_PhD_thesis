        <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
        <p>
          Since 1994, CARDIS is the foremost international conference dedicated to smart card research and applications. Smart cards and secure elements are the basis for many secure systems and play a decisive role in ID management. Established computer science areas like hardware design, operating systems, system modelling, cryptography, verification and networking got adapted to this fast growing technology and investigate emerging issues resulting from it. Unlike events devoted to commercial and application aspects of smart cards, CARDIS conferences gather researchers and technologists who focus on all aspects of the design, development, deployment, validation and application of smart cards and secure elements in secure platforms or systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fourteenth Smart Card Research and Advanced Application Conference is organized by Horst Görtz Institute for IT-Security (HGI) at Ruhr University Bochum (RUB), Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program committee is seeking original papers on all aspects of smart cards and secure elements. Submissions across a broad range of the development phases are encouraged, from exploratory research and proof-of-concept studies to practical applications and deployment of smart cards and related technologies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul class="content_list">
            <li> Cryptographic protocols for embedded systems</li>
            <li >Efficient and secure implementations of cryptographic algorithms</li>
            <li> Hardware architectures for secure embedded systems</li>
            <li> Physical attacks and countermeasures</li>
            <li> Validation and certification of embedded systems and applications</li>
            <li> Formal modelling and formal proofs</li>
            <li> Identity, privacy and trust issues and management for secure embedded systems and applications</li>
            <li> Security of smart cards, mobile devices, RFID/NFC, and embedded systems</li>
            <li> Secure applications for smart cards, mobile devices, RFID/NFC, and embedded systems</li>
            <li> Emerging applications for smart cards, mobile devices, RFID/NFC, and embedded systems</li>
            <li> Software and execution environments for secure embedded systems (operating systems, Java Card, virtual machines, trusted execution, ...)</li>
            <li> Anti-cloning and anti-counterfeiting technologies</li>
            <li> Embedded devices forensic and anti-forensic techniques</li>
            <li> Embedded systems bug detection, hardware Trojans and mitigation techniques</li>
          </ul>

        <p>
          Authors are invited to submit papers (PDF or PS format) with novel contributions electronically using the submission form available on the following web site: <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cardis2015">http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cardis2015</a>.
          Submitted papers must be original, unpublished, anonymous and not submitted to journals or other conferences/workshops that have proceedings. Submissions must be written in English and should be at most 15 pages in total. Papers not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration. All submissions will be blind-refereed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper. The proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Accepted papers should follow the LNCS default author instructions at <a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html">http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html</a>.
