<font size="6" color="Magenta">T-MATS: SS NR Solver w Jacobian Calc Library Block</font>
<br>
The Steady State Newton Raphson Solver with Jacobian Calculator block will
supply the inputs to iteratively drive the outputs of a system to zero.
<br>
<br>
This will be performed in three steps.<br>
1) Jabobian calculator sends Perturbations to the plant then calculates the plant
Jacboian based on the system response <br>
2) The Newton Raphson will use the inverse of the Jacobian to iteratively step the
system toward solution.<br>
3) Once the solution has satisfied the conditions the Newton Raphson is shut off.
<br>
<br>
Simulation run time length should be selected as to give the
Newton Raphson solver adequate time to develop a solution.
