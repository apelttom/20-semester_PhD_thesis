iGEM project

	* simulation of wild type chemotaxis
	* detection of various cell types
	* transfer of image data between a microscope and Matlab

The Lemming toolbox has, among others, the following features:
	* Two molecular ODE models of the light switch, PhyB/PIF3 and ALR.
	* Four molecular ODE models of the chemotaxis pathway, based on the published models of Spiro et al. (1997), Mello & Tu (2003), Rao et al (2004) and Barkai & Leibler (1997).
	* A stochastic model of the movement of E. coli generating paths for an E. coli cell for time varying bias signals.
	* Various image sources, e.g. modules loading saved microscope images, generating microscope look-alike images from simulations, or pulling images in real-time from a microscope(1).
	* Fast cell detection and tracking algorithms compatible with all image sources.
	* Visualization methods for real-time post-processing and displaying microscope images, together with an intuitive representation of the results of upstream modules like cell detection.
	* Various user input possibilities, like real-time control of modules with either a joystick or the keyboard.
	* Modules enabling the control of a automated microscope with Matlab scripts(1).
	* Intuitive graphical user interface based on Simulink, which can fully be combined with other Simulink toolboxes.
	* Modular and expandable design.
	* Open Source under the GNU General Public License.
	* Platform independent.

The following requirements are only necessary to be able to use all features of the Lemming Toolbox. 
Most modules can still be used even if one or several of the requirements are not fulfilled. 
In such cases, we recommand to simply download the Toolbox and test the corresponding modules. 
We tried to make this list comprehensive, however we cannot guarantee that we did not miss one or several requirements. 
The following requirements we are aware of:
	* Matlab R2007b or higher (not tested with lower versions).
	* Installed Image Processing Toolbox.
	* Installed Simulink 3D Animation (former named Virtual Reality Toolbox).
	* Approximately 24 MB of free disk space.
	* When using the joystick input: Joystick with at least three axes and six buttons. Force feedback optional.
	* For smooth real-time image analysis we recommend at least a 1GHz processor with 1024 MB RAM.
